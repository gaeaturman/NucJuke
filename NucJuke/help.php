        <h6>As of <?php date_default_timezone_set('America/Los_Angeles'); echo date("F j Y"); ?>, this tool is still being validated, so while we cannot definitively say which filtering method is best, we currently recommend you
            <br/> stick to the dynamic re-ranking method. By doing this you allow for a more encapsulating filtration of your gRNAs since you're allowing them
            <br/> to be evaluated on two parameters. We'll be sure to keep this page updated in the event of any changes though. <h6>

                <h4 class="bigger">Why can't I filter my gRNAs from _______ site?</h4>
                <h6>While we hope to integrate gRNA checking for all the sites one might use in the future, we've currently kept to implementing it
                    <br/> for those sites we have used most often. You can always feel free to email us though and we would be more than happy to add
                    <br/> support for your favorite gRNA design site! Otherwise, you can also organize your own gRNAs into a tab separated file
                    <br/> with the following format: Rank   Sequence    Chromosome  Location(bp). We do this mainly because there are many different
                    <br/> route that allows us to be fairly certain your gRNAs will get properly formatted. There are many, many different possible ways
                    <br/> way to organize gRNA information in a file. Having this information and sticking to specificed sites allows us to be certain of
                    <br/> the format of your gRNA information. Without this it's very hard for us to filter your gRNAs appropriately.
